## Usage

### ES Modules in Node

We us ECMAScript Modules in the backend in this project. Be sure to have at least Node v14.6+ or you will need to add the "--experimental-modules" flag.

Also, when importing a file (not a package), be sure to add .js at the end or you will get a "module not found" error

You can also install and setup Babel if you would like

### Env Variables

## 1. Env file of Frontend React App

Create a .env file in folder ./frotend and add the following

```
HTTPS = true // to use Facebook login
REACT_APP_JWT_SECRET = your_jwt_secret
REACT_APP_BACKEND_HOST = http://localhost:5000
```

## 2. Env file of Backend NodeJS App

Create a .env file in then root and add the following

```
NODE_ENV = development
PORT = 5000
MONGO_URI = your_mongodb_uri
JWT_SECRET = your_jwt_secret
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID = your_paypal_client_id

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = your_aws_access_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = your_aws_secret_key

FACEBOOK_CLIENT_APP_ID = your_FB_ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_APP_ID = your_GG_ID

FRONTEND_HOST_ADDRESS = https://localhost:3000

EMAIL_USER_NAME = your_email_to_use_nodemailer
EMAIL_PASSWORD = your_email_password
```

### Run With Docker

## 1. Create image for backend - server (nodejs app)
```
docker build . -t image-backend
```
### if use want run only the backend-server image:
```
docker run -d --env-file ./.env -p 2222:3000 --name container-backend image-backend  
```
### Open browses at http://localhost:2222 to see server

## 2. Create image for frontend - client (react app)
```
cd frontend
docker build . -t image-frontend
````
### if use want run only the client image:
```
docker run -d --env-file ./.env -p 2121:3000 --name container-frontend image-frontend 
```
### Open browses at https://localhost:2121 to see client


## 3. Run both backend (http://localhost:5000) & frontend (https://localhost:3000)

```
cd .. (back to the root path of the project)
docker-compose up -d

# Go to http://localhost:5000 & https://localhost:3000 to see the website
```

### Install Dependencies (frontend & backend)

```
npm install
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Run Without Docker

cd frontend && npm run start
or
npm run client

# Run backend only
npm run server

# Run frontend (https://localhost:3000) & backend (http://localhost:5000)
